# Lexer_midterm_group14

## How to run this project on command line
Firstly, download every single file from this directory and put them inside a `lexer` folder. Change the directory to `lexer`, remove the object files and executables generated by previous builds, check current directory's status.
```
cd path_to_lexer
make clean
ls
```
Compile VC.c and Lexer.c to generate VC.o and Lexer.o respectively, link these object files with the compiler to create a scan executable. Scan executable outputs `*.vctok` files and display file content.
```
make
./scan
./scan example_fib.vc example_fib.vctok
less example_fib.vctok
./scan example_gcd.vc example_gcd.vctok
less example_gcd.vctok
``` 
## Input
2 sample `*.vc` files inside code directory.
## Output
- Corresponding `*.vctok` files with each line containing a token and its info.
- DFA.dat file containing starting (0), terminal states with its identified morphemes and transition table.
